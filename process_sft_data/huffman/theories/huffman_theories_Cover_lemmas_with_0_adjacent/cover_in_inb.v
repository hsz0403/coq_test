Variable empty : A.
Inductive cover : list (btree A) -> btree A -> Prop := | cover_one : forall t, cover (t :: []) t | cover_node : forall l1 l2 t1 t2 t3, permutation l1 (t1 :: t2 :: l2) -> cover (node t1 t2 :: l2) t3 -> cover l1 t3.

Fixpoint all_cover_aux (l : list (btree A)) (n : nat) {struct n} : list (btree A) := match n with | O => [] | S n1 => flat_map (fun l1 => match l1 with | [] => [] | a :: [] => a :: [] | a :: b :: l2 => all_cover_aux (node a b :: l2) n1 end) (all_permutations l) end.
Definition all_cover l := all_cover_aux l (length l).
Definition cover_dec : (forall a b : A, {a = b} + {a <> b}) -> forall l t, {cover l t} + {~ cover l t}.
Proof.
intros H l t; case (In_dec (btree_dec _ H) t (all_cover l)).
intros H1; left; apply all_cover_cover; auto.
intros H1; right; contradict H1; apply cover_all_cover; auto.
Defined.

Theorem cover_in_inb : forall l t1 t2, cover l t1 -> In t2 l -> inb t2 t1.
Proof using.
intros l t1 t2 H H0; apply cover_in_inb_inb with (1 := H) (2 := H0); auto.
